    <p>This is a 1971 Dodge Daytona. These cars were only manufactured for one year, 1971. They are also the only car to compete in NASCAR races off the production line. These cars are great for Standing mile events, because they came factory with a large wing for added weight on the back end. The most famous of these cars is shown in the image, ran at the Bonneville Salt flats by Bobby Isaac.</p>
